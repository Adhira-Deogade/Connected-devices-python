#### [Presentation](https://bit.ly/34nojhU)

#### [Module 01](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module01) - System performance monitoring
An app that will read basic system performance data from the device.
##### Tasks:
1. **_psutil_** to obtain system performance information
2. Implement thread that runs periodically for 10 seconds to obatin the information
3. Display information on console in human-readable format

#### [Module 02](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module02) - Basic data processing
A simple data processing application on an IoT device (real or emulated).
Summary: The app will perform processing of basic data from an IoT device sensor (e.g. camera, GPIO-based sensor, etc.) using both open source libraries and custom developed software to handle sensor events and notify a local or remote system using one or more IoT protocols.

#### [Module 03](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module03) - Sensor and actuator processing
A simple sensor processing and actuator engagement application on an IoT device.
Summary: The app will process data from an IoT sensor (e.g: Camera, GPIO-based sensor, etc) and trigger a simluated state change on a GPIO-based sensor/actuator (e.g: LED display) using both open source libraries and custom developed software. It will - 
- handle sensor events
- notify local/remote system
- retrieve stage change
- trigger simulated state change on actuator

#### [Module 04](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module04) - On device processing
A simple application that reads data directly from the SenseHAT on a Raspberry Pi 3.
Summary: The app will interact with various sensors connected to RPi's GPIO with I2C protocol, SenseHat and python libraries. It will read data from SenseHAT sensor module and display it on SenseHAT LEDs.

#### [Module 05](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module05) - Message processing
Two simple applications that generate, write, and read sensor data using the _json_ format.
Summary: The app will interact with various sensors connected to RPi's GPIO with I2C protocol, SenseHat and python libraries. It will read data from SenseHAT sensor module and display it on SenseHAT LEDs.

#### [Module 06](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module06) - Session protocol: MQTT
A simple client application that will communicate with an MQTT broker

#### [Module 07](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module07) - Session protocol: CoAP
A simple client application that will communicate with a custom-built CoAP server

#### [Module 08](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module09) - Cloud integration with [Ubidots](https://ubidots.com/)
A simple client application that will communicate with a remote cloud service (Ubidots)

#### [Module 10](https://github.com/Adhira-Deogade/cd-github-python/tree/master/apps/labs/module10)
IoT based voice controlled personal assistant and home security system with alarm and Google cloud
